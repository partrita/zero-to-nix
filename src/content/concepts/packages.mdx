  Software bundles built (and potentially distributed) using the [Nix package manager](/concepts/nix) (이하 내용은 원본 유지)
related: ["derivations", "nix-store"]
---

Nix _packages_ are self-contained bundles that are built using [derivations] and provide some kind of software or dependencies of software on your computer.
A package can have dependencies on other packages, which are encoded in its [closure].
Each package lives at a unique path in the [Nix store](/concepts/nix-store) indexed by its name and its input hash.

[closure]: /concepts/closures
[derivations]: /concepts/derivations
